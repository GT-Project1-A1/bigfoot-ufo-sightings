((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for responding.  The object seemed sphere or disc shaped.  The object was extremely far away, but we were able to see every color.  At one point a plane flew under the object and we were able to see how large it was in comparison.  It was at least two or three times the size of the aircraft.  The object ended up hovering for over an hour that we saw.  At one point the object dipped down and we noticed a smaller object below it that was similar.  When the larger object reached the smaller one, all of the sudden the smaller object disappeared.  We then noticed a large plane that flew under the large object flying North. The large object then suddenly disappeared. Please understand that I have never believed in UFO's nor do I believe in conspiracy theories.  This is a true account of what we have seen. I was not alone in seeing this object.  I do have a recording but my camera is so bad that it is difficult to see any of the colors that we saw on the recording.

What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls\u00a0from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers\u00a0like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed. This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow\u00a0as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get\u00a0 over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base. This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing\u00a0 that any aircraft or helicopter could do.

{"text": "Abnormal flashing object in SoCal As an avid skywatcher since birth (51 hrs), I take pride in my recognition skills concerning flying objects.  While relaxing on my back porch after a long day of work, I noticed what appeared to be a flashing satellite.  The trajectory was circumpolar and velocity was consistant with average satellites.  The object was first noticed at the zenith.  The first flash was of approximately -6 magnitude brightness and lasted 3 seconds.  So far this seemed normal for a rotating solar paneled satellite.  Every 22 seconds the object flashed at a consistent magnitude until it disappeared over the northern horizon.  The odd thing is the flashing was consistent brightness as though the light was radiating all directions. Normal rotating satellites will flash at most twice before the change in orbital position relative to the observer makes the solar panels flash to a single spot on the earths surface.  The next flash would be hundreds of miles away from the observer one would th! ink.  This is the first time I\u2019ve seen this phenomenon and have seen thousands of satellites in my skywatching.

{"text": "1965 Dark Grey Cylinder UFO Updated Statement I just wanted to offer an updated version, the original being:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25728.html  \"Every now and then, my mother and I would take our dog on his night walk to the Parade Ground, a flat park of baseball and football fields. We went there because at the time it was being renovated, and the fields were being partitioned and fenced. This gave us some confidence to allow the dog off the leash to run free for a change.  The Parade Ground is just across Parkside Avenue from Prospect Park. It is August, 1965. I am ten years old.  The dog was having a good run, and once we saw that he wasn't about to run off completely, we relaxed and gazed upwards to view the night sky, trying to find various constellations.  In those days, the street lights in Brooklyn emitted a white light, and not the beige-looking type now in use. If you went to a park, you could get a decent view of the stars, but of course not anywhere near the view if you were upstate in deep woods.  Suddenly, as I looked to the left of me, I saw what I first mentally equated as a submarine perhaps two storeys off the ground higher than the six storey buildings beneath it.  \"Hey Mom, do you see what I see?\" She did.  Here comes this thing, slow and steady and silent. It is huge. It is dark grey - not \"battleship grey,\" but as grey as can be before you rule it black. There is no shine to it.  The front of it was round; I'd seen pictures of submarines, and that is what came to mind. It is actually shaped more like a very long medicine capsule.  As it  proceeded to float past us, we observed its right side. It is solid. It is a perfect and very long dark grey cylinder, and it just keeps coming very slowly and steadily.  Obviously, we can't see the top of it, but so far, we see that even though it is almost black, we sense a light behind the darkness. This does not make sense, as my mother and I later reckoned. The best I can come up with is that my eyes saw dark grey, but my mind knew the cylinder was emitting light. Dark light!  This was no blimp. No lights. No sound. No windows. No gondola beneath. No visible markings. No nothing! It is just a cylinder 300 feet longer than the Intrepid aircraft carrier now docked in the Hudson River going by!  This thing was so huge, that even from the height above me, (200 Feet?) it was clearly visible; visible enough to see even the slightest imperfection clearly, if it had any.  At the same time, we are not in any panic. We are unusually serene. As if it's no big deal somehow. Maybe we were in a stupor beyond awe.  Finally, the end of the ship passes. I ran to see the back of it. I see it is as round as the front with an opening in the center. To this day, I'm not sure if it was square or arch-like. I am convinced that at least the bottom of the opening in the back of it was flat, so it was square or arched. I remember thinking that 3 buses could easily drive inside at the same time. On the other hand, I've seen jets low to the ground on approach to JFK Airport, and thought that \"my\" cylinder was at least 3 times wider at the same height.  This is the only time I experience apprehension. I worry for a moment that whoever is flying this cylinder might see me.  I ran to a to where I could see the other side of the cylinder. It is exactly as perfect and unremarkable as the other side and the bottom.  I have been struggling with my memories for years as to whether there was a single tiny light, blue or red atop the opening in the back. I add this item, but I am not sure. Inside the opening it is absolutely pitch black.  The cylinder was in the order of 1200 feet long. I did not know this at the time. When I saw the cylinder completely, it was \"crossing\" Stratford Road, and the back of it was at Buckinham Road. The distance between these streets on Caton Avenue according to street maps is about 1200 feet.  I rejoined my mother in the original field, and we watched this thing float over the Prospect Park POLICE STATION, heading west until it faded from sight about half a mile west of the Parade Ground. No newspaper, radio, or TV station mentioned it. For that matter, we didn't even tell my father!  As I first accessed the Internet, I ran a search for \"cylinder ufo,\" and plenty of links came up. Even pictures! I wasn't too surprised, because I know damn well what I saw was real, and other people MUST have seen something as well.  I told some close friends. They gave me the jaundiced eye. I could hardly blame them. I guess its just one of those things one must see to believe.\"  Notes:  The Cylinder crossed over Parade Place, and was equidistant between Woodruff and Crooke Avenues.  The Cylinder was about 1/4 the width of the Parade Ground, and travelling in a straight line over the road that runs nearly the length of the park.  Why these single lane streets are designated Avenues is a mystery to me, especially Crooke Avenue, which runs only two blocks.  Modern street maps have re-named Buckingham Road as East 16th street. The equivalent for Stratford Road would be East 11th Street, so by my point of view the cylinder was at least five blocks in length. I need to remark that some internet-based street maps would put the length of the cylinder at 1500-1700 feet. I really should go back there and take measurements myself.", "stats": "Occurred : 8/20/1965 20:30  (Entered as : 08/20/65 20:30) Reported: 3/25/2006 6:33:21 PM 18:33 Posted: 5/15/2006 Location: New York City (Brooklyn), NY Shape: Cylinder Duration:minutes", "date_time": "8/20/65 20:30", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49816.html", "city": "New York City (Brooklyn)", "state": "NY", "shape": "Cylinder", "duration": "minutes", "summary": "1965 Dark Grey Cylinder UFO Updated Statement", "posted": "5/15/06"}

{"text": "My sighting of two objects in Chicago, IL as a pre-teen in the early 50's This event happened when I was a young boy, just pre-teen when I'd guess I was about 12.  I'm now 65 and want to leave this report before I can't.  This would put the event in the very early 50's.  I lived in a south suburb of Chicago (on a small farm), about 20 miles SSW of downtown.  The township was Calumet Park, IL.  One afternoon I was standing in the yard looking due North.  Suddenly coming out of the west there was a very high, extremely fast round object moving west to east.  The speed was unlike anything I had ever seen.  Many times that of the fastest plane.  From the ground the view angle was probably about 60 degrees.  From my distance it appeared to be about three or so times the size of a pin head held at arm's length.  When it was due north of my location it suddenly came to a stop, motionless.  It remained that way for several minutes.  Then another identical object came from the East at the same blazing speed.  It came to a stop right by the other one.  Now there were two of the round objects together.  They hovered for a few minutes.  Then they went straight up, got smaller and smaller until I couldn't see them any more.  There was no sound, no vapor or contrails.  The day was bright and clear, not a cloud in the sky.  No wind.  Just a perfect summer day.  I remember the temperature being plesant too, which would normally mean early summer or late,late spring.  In the above part of the form I'm only guessing month-day-year.

{"text": "Flaming ball of light making right angle turns seen from front porch on a hot summer's night. It was a very hot summer evening and seeing as how we did not have air conditioning my older sister, younger brother and I were permitted to sleep on our front porch, since it was cooler than our bedrooms.  Since this occurred so many years ago, the actual year could have been 1954 or might have even been 1956.  In any case, I was 8 or 9 years old at the time.  Around 1:00 A.M. in the morning, I had to get up and use the bathroom.  I know it was around 1:00 A.M. because our clock struck the hour before I went back out onto the front porch.  As I was settling back down to go to sleep, I heard what could be likened to the sound of an 18 wheeler when it shifts down to a lower gear, and there was also a hissing sound like steam.  I sat up and since I thought it was a truck coming down our little side road, I wanted to see that unusual sight.  Imagine my shock when instead of a truck, there in the sky was a fireball.  It was skimming along just above the trees lining a creek on the other side of the road.  It made a sharp right angle turn, and after it moved off perhaps 75 feet or so, it looked like it was dripping something flammable from beneath it.  Suddenly it stopped.  And just as I thought to myself....\"uh oh, they see me\"....  The next thing I remember is sitting on the front porch, and somehow the craft had already moved off some distance.  I tried to wake up my sister, but by the time I got her to wake up, it was out of sight.  The strange thing about this whole ordeal, was that it was already beginning to get light outside when I watched this craft move off.  I went from 1:00 A.M. to daylight without any memory.  I told my mom about what happened, and she only suggested that I not tell anyone about what had occurred...and I haven't until now.  I am now married, retired, and no longer live in Missouri, and I don't see where this information is going to hurt anyone; and perhaps someone will find it useful or interesting.

{"text": "children see flying saucer in small East Texas town The day and the year of this sighting is a guess.  At the time of the sighting, I am guessing my age to be eight or nine years old.   My nephew and I were outside in front of my home at dusk. We were lying in the grass beside the road.  We would jump up as a car drove by and attempt to scare the drivers.  We were children and weren't being watched closely!  While waiting for the next car, a \"flying saucer\" slipped from NNE to SSW at tree top level.  I can still see that saucer clearly in my mind after all these years.  It made no sound.  It made a Z movement as it slipped through the air. That Z movement impressed me, because in 1995 when I saw my second UFO, it made that same Z movement.  My nephew was no younger than two but probably not yet four when we saw the saucer.  He remembers it. He had to be old enough to talk, because when we saw it, we turned to each other and yelled, \"UFO\"!  We also had to have heard \"UFO\" on the television or radio for us to know that term!   We ran into the house, but neither of us remember what happened after that and there is no one left alive who could tell us.  The only difference in our memory of this sighting is that he remembers windows in the saucer and I don't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They remained there at least for 10 minutes, and my father called  -- I believe -- the Oregonian to report it.  I remember that the paper said they had received a number of calls on it.  I also remember that the paper printed a squib about it after that, basically saying that stationary lights were observed over the city and that the Air Force was notified, and that the Air Force indicated that it would look into it.

{"text": "Observation of spherical white colored craft in geostationary position for 1 hour plus. The altitude at a guess at 2,000 feet high. This was seen on September 4, 1962 at 3:30 pm Central Standard Time. Location of sighting was 2.6 miles south of St. Louis Lambert airport. The sky was clear and wind was calm. My mother was hanging clothes out to dry, and called out to me to come out and see the object. I rejected her offer for some time, but she insisted that it was  something I should see. When I finally went out and saw the object we talked and she asked if it could be Venus? I told her that it could not be because of the time of day and direction was eastward. I was a member of the St. Louis Astronomical Society at this time. My mom said I should get my telescope and take a look. At the age of 15 I wasn't totally coordinated yet, and I broke the front glass out of the front screen door. Trying to get the telescope out the door. I'm adding for the time frame. It took a bit of work to gather the broken glass up before a got the telescope to the back yard. Setting up the telescope. It was a Tasco refractor 60 mm objective lens, with a alt-azimuth mount. I first used the wide angle eyepiece to spot the object. I found it magnified well, but still rather small. I let my mom look through the scope and by this time we had the next door neighbors over also. So now we have our own star party. Three adults and one kid. I let everyone take there time and look. Of course they all asked if I could get it bigger. I set the 3 X barlow and the strongest eyepiece. This set the magnification of 525 power. When I looked at the object it nearly filled the entire field of view.  I can only explain that I had it focused perfect!  It looked like a cue ball.  No markings.  Perfectly smooth and rather off white, not shiny.  It did not give any glow off.  No sense of spinning motion, and no noise at all. This is important. This object has not moved one nanometer in an hour of time. Nothing in the heavens or earth can do that!  When you view the moon at full power with that telescope it's like a big train moving by. This didn't move. I expected it to move and was in total disbelief at what I was seeing. I let my mom and the neighbors husband and wife both take long looks at the object and we all agreed that it was not moving. I kept saying this can't be happening! No one is going to believe me at the next Astronomical meeting. But I got witnesses!  Better yet I've done lunar eclipse photos, and said I will be getting my camera and special eye mount for it and I'll be back. Never had a chance to move. When we look back at the time in history, it was as one of the worst in nuclear confutations. The \"Cuban missile crisis\" was happening. I no sooner said that I was going to get the camera when I hear a very load jet aircraft take off. Living for many year near the airport we grew accustomed to the different sounds of the commercial, and air force aircraft flying and even crashing near by as a F-86 did a mile down the road. This was the sound of afterburners and full throttle. As soon as the plane came above the tree line I spotted it as a B-47. She was doing a tight circle as we literality turned our bodies around as it circled and climbed for altitude. On the second sweep around I was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with our visitor in the sky above. I was a lucky hunch, because at that very moment I scream! Look it moved! What had been stationary for an hour did a sudden straight vertical movement to twice the altitude in a split second and stopped. The B-47 was still in hot pursuit with all engines at full throttle. It kept a circular pattern as she climbed up toward the object. After about the fourth revolution around the B-47 chase was over. I saw the object go from that second position to ascend straight up out of sight. My mom insisted that I report this to the Air Force base at Lambert Field. I looked up a few numbers that sounded official and dialed them. When I mentioned I wanted to report a UFO, they responded I could get in a lot of trouble doing this. Did my parents know I was doing crank calls to the US Government? The last call I made I did get through to an Air Force official and said I wanted to report a UFO and it was being chased by a B-47. He said that's ridicules there's no B-47 aircraft in the air. I said if you don't believe me look out your window. He hung up quickly.  No report was ever made to the papers that I could ever recall.

I walked around the corner of our house to where they were wrestling on the lawn.  All of the sudden they stopped wrestling and stood straight up.  At the same time all three of us looked directly above us.  There, hovering, was a large, round, silver object directly above us.  It was low enough that I could make out what looked like dimples in the skin of the object - almost like hammered metal.  Since it was right above us, I don't know whether it was a sphere, or whether we were just looking at the bottom side of a saucer shaped object.   As we watched the object it slowly moved behind a cloud. We watched the cloud for a long time and as it dispersed we realized the object was gone. My entire family loves airplanes and anything to do with space. My parents used to wake us in the middle of the night when important things were happening with Mercury/Gemini/Apollo, and were being televised. I knew that what we saw that day was very strange. At the time I don't know whether we had ever heard the term UFO, but have realized in my adult life what we saw.

As we reached the crest of the hill that led down to our home, I noticed a white/silvery light in the distance over the trees as we looked almost due east (or barely southeast). There was nothing else in sky as it was a clear summer day and I called attention to this unknown light to my mother.  She was surprised at the light and pulled the car over to the side of the road and we began watching the light in the distance(it was off in the distance but I can only guess 10-20 miles away.  When I first spotted this light what caught my attention was the fact that it was at times stationary but would then move up in a direct perpendicular line and would then sometomes move sideways in a direct horizontal line. These movements were in the blink of an eye and guessing at the distance I would say these horizontal and perpendicular movements were many miles in seconds.  We watched this movement for about 15 minutes and the mental image I have is of this unknown light/object making a cross or plus sign in the sky.  As we watched this movement we both commented and agreed that there was nothing we knew of on this earth that could move and change directions so quickly and stop in an an instant.  As we were watching this movement for about 15 minutes all of a sudden the light blinked out. This surprised us and we were going to proceed on home when the light blinked back on and reappeared in about the same spot as we originally saw it.  It made a few more horizontal/perpendicular movements and blinked out again and did not reappear. The total duration of this event was about 20 minutes.

{"text": "Livingston NJ UFO sighting, Time stopped! I was eight years old when this event occurred, I was sitting with my baby sister in a pontiac convertible while my brother was sitting in the front seat with my Mother. We all had mixed emotions. My Mom was frightened, I wished to leave the car, and she kept screaming for me not too! She recently died.  Until now I was not allowed by my family to discuss the event. We held it in our family. My brother has zero problems talking about this, nor my sister but my Mom was frightened to a point where she tried to speed away in our car, however time stopped, we could not move! It was really fascinating I thought?  I knew all about UFO encounters as my father was in the Korean war and the US Air Force.  This occurred while we were heading home from my grandmothers home in Short Hills, NJ on Old Short Hills Road prior to reaching Walnut Street in Livingston. I remember the UFO was hovering near the property that had a hidden resevoir behind it, and alot of power lines. I lived on the East Orange Resevoir in Livingston NJ and knew that some people thought UFO's where seen near water, so I was use to going and playing and ice skating on the resevoir and had zero fear, however my Mother would not allow the door to open and the car only had two front doors, and she remained fixed behind the wheel of the Pontiac convertible. I asked her years later why this scared her and she refused to speak ever about it.   However when I arrived home to Baker Road, I phoned my Dad whom worked in the Menlo Park Mall in Edison he owned a furniture store there.  He was working late that night.  I do recall we left during semi-daylight and arrove home in the dark!   He told me to call the Morristown Airport and report it! I did, at a small age, I never forgot this experience and have had an insatiable yet calm interest and patience abpout this topic.  I was married in 1977 at the young age of 17 years old, and when I told my future husbands Mother about how I had witnessed a UFO, she declared,\" Wow, I saw it along with most of my eight children and my husband, who at that time worked for Bell Labs in NJ,  My Dad was working close to the Thomas Edison Labs in Edison NJ at that time.  We always wondered, if this UFO had something to do with the fact we did marry and have a son?  Many years later yet young as teens. I do truly believe that the UFO's come out of the Bermuda Triangle and are seen by many.  I saw on the news in the 1990's UFO's hovering over Phoenix, that was not like our experience.  Time stopping, I remember the exact clearing in the woods where this occurred, the exact home it happened in front of too. It is amazing to me that I am now 47 and this still perplexes me although I realize my Mom was aware of military interogation, blue book files etc, from my Father collecting Time Magazines, and the fact he always was into the paranormal!  Alot of people in my immediate family saw this occur, aprox 13 of us are alive to talk about it.  I have drawn it, however do not share it. I feel that we all have individual incounters and that they may be helping or hurting us? I do not want to open a pandora's box. I feel this is how my Mom was protecting me and my siblings, or I could have been reporting a encounter of the third kind or missing! I am glad I am not doing that. I wish all of you success. Do you realize that the UFO's are hanging out near the USA submarine bases? Look on the World Map? I do not know but would like to if they are hanging around other countrys submarine bases? They are built by General Dynamic's and Electric Boat, the fact that our Star Wars program has begune makes me feel like I just may see one soon, since I live near the Bangor Wa submarine base now? Who knows? It can not be a cooincidence, your tracking is excellent in my mind. Keep up the fantastic work and I will report any others I happen to see, to the US Navy or Marines since my son is a US Marine he told me I may have had response had I called them in NJ, way back when I was a little girl. True story, no additions. The craft was circular and looked invisible however you could see windows and lights. Within the circle. when I was interogated by my Dad in a most professional way, and this is more then likely why I have such a memory! I told him exactly what I am telling you, This craft flew over us, and then all of the cars behind us could move, and my Mother could have had a speeding ticket~! However we got home safe, and I wrang Dad He was excited and wanted to know more, at such a young age I was allowed to stay up late and explain and try and draw what I saw! It was round, perfectly, looked to have some sort of craft in the center, like if it were spinning or creating a temporary worm hole? It had beings in it, as they gazed at me out of tiny slits, within the outer ring, sort of how Jupiter has rings this one had one bright light ring belt around it.the center looked like an inverted bubble, unlike all of the drawings my Father had seen elsewhere mine was upside down? He did not question me. I still stick to seeing what I did indeed see, my brother remember it too. I have not asked my little baby sister because I do remember she was in a car seat at this time, so she was a baby of around two, it would definitely be in her memory from Dad bragging that his wife and family saw a UFO for real!", "stats": "Occurred : 6/15/1968 18:00  (Entered as : 1968 18:00) Reported: 4/17/2006 10:43:37 PM 22:43 Posted: 5/15/2006 Location: Livingston, NJ Shape: Disk Duration:time stopped", "date_time": "6/15/68 18:00", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50171.html", "city": "Livingston", "state": "NJ", "shape": "Disk", "duration": "time stopped", "summary": "Livingston NJ UFO sighting, Time stopped!", "posted": "5/15/06"}

{"text": "UFO over Orangevale, CA in May/June 1969 My fiance had 2 friends over and they were in sleeping bags in his backyard.  They were just falling asleep when the backyard was lit as bright as noon on a sunny day. My fiance also told me all three guys mentioned that their zippers and/or metal buttons on their clothing and sleeping bags got very warm. There was no noise, just the intense light.  They darted into the house and tried to watch whatever it was out of the patio door. They never saw a \"shape\", just the light beam at that point. After it moved away, my fiance ran down to the house where I was staying while my mother was at my grandmother's funeral.  He tapped on the window and when I awoke, he told me what they had just seen.  I got dressed and joined him in a grassy field across from his house and we watched as this bright light moved slowly around the Orangevale area (very rural in 1969).  As it moved, it shot a beam of light down every once in awhile.  We heard various animals make noise in the area the beam was shining.  We watched this for several minutes, then I told my fiance to call McClellan AFB in North Highlands, CA since that is where my step-father was currently stationed.  He did but they claimed they didn't know anything about the object we were seeing in the sky so they referred us to Mather AFB. We called them but they claimed the same thing.  We no sooner got back outside and all of a sudden there were 4 jets flying in from 4 directions, directly at the light.  As they approached, the light became brilliantly bright, then shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. The jets circled for a couple of minutes, then left. About one minute later, the light came slowly back down and continued its slow progress around the countryside. Every time it made an abrupt turn, it became brighter, then after it turned, it dimmed to \"normal\" again.   BTW, there was no moon that night so it was pitch black outside and all the stars were clearly visible, and if anyone claims it was Venus, well, it doesn't move - at least not very fast! No helicopter whump, whump, whump. And besides, helicopters - even today - can't do what that light did. And whatever it was, it out flew 4 jets.

{"text": "Silent trapezoid (triangle with its head cut off). Oklahoma, 1971. One fairly clear evening (~8:45) at dusk, in the summer of 1971, my brother (11) and I (male, 13) visited our 3 friends [Female(14), female (12) and male (8)], who had relocated from the Houston area the previous summer. We were outside Broken Bow, OK. We were west (~5 miles) and somewhat south of the city and in a very rural area. We were walking north to see their church at night -- an exciting/scary thing to do! The birds had stopped singing and the crickets had not yet started, so it was very quite. I noticed that there were three lights toward Broken bow that were not blinking. I asked if they had any towers out there and they said they didn't know. And something was mentioned about their living in that particular location (on rural acreage in a mobile home) only since December (~7 months). So we just kept walking toward the church. About a minute or so later, we looked up to see a very large opaque trapezoid (triangle with its head cut off) with three lights. It was moving very slowly toward the sun that had already set. The narrow end of the trapezoid led and the wide end followed. It blocked out the atmospheric haze that was still aglow because the sun was not quite completely gone. It continued westward until it was obscured by the wooded area to the west of us. The lights were as such, two in the front on each corner and one in the north corner only. I do not remember their colors. The amazing thing is that it made no noise. There is no way to be certain of its size/height, although if I had to guess, since I thought the lights were towers, then it must not have been too high, assuming it maintained its height. If it was that height, I'd guess it to be about 1/3 the size of a football field.  I was elated to hear about the one in Phoenix in the 1990's. Although it was chevron-shaped, and had more lights, like ours, it was hovering, expansive and silent. I assume the aliens have changed their designs over the years; either out of boredom or out of necessity, scientific or economic - gotta keep up with the Joneses-Snergabloids. LOL.

{"text": "I looked up to identify the source of the sound and saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of pattern. On a quiet warm summer night I pulled up to my parent's house where I still lived while finishing my second college year. Across the street there was a high school football field with an old wood grandstand on the opposite side that faces the field and across to our house. Getting out of the car I heard an intermittent buzzing sound which seemed to come from the field. I thought it might be new sprinklers but the sound was odd so my curiosity was aroused. As I attempted to focus on the sound it shifted from the left to the center of the field and it also echoed off the grandstand. Audibly I realized it was off the ground. I looked up attempting to identify the source of the sound and I saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of rotating pattern.It appeared to have followed my car and was maneuvering in a tightening circle thus shortening its trajectory directly at me, and it was descending. I was awestruck long enough to observe subtle lights of green, red, blue and white on the bottom of the object. I have piloted a plane, boated, and I understand navigation lights well and these were not regular navigation lights. My hair stood on end as I was aware that I was likely witnessing a greatly advanced mechanical object. Suddenly, in sheer animal panic, I ran to the back porch of the house. I was really shaking as I fumbled with the key to unlock the door and the buzzing got louder indicating that it was getting closer yet. I rushed in and yelled at my parents who had been in bed a little while. They came out to the kitchen by the porch but the sound dissipated and they didn't hear it. Reflecting back, the object seemed rather small, perhaps smaller than my car. I am a sane and logical person and I truly believe what I experienced was not of this world, or at least anything mankind has created.

{"text": "huge orange circular fireball in Quebec I've seen these fireballs twice in my life. I lived in the countryside back then in Les Escoumins, a small village in the province of Quebec in Canada.  The first  time i was about 5 years old . I am now 38 years old. The second time it was about 2 or 3 years after that .  The first time we were several people who saw it. We called neighbours and they saw it as well. It was a huge round orange fireball crossing the horizon line.  The sun was on the west side and that fireball was going towards Maine ( so it was going from north to south when looking into the west direction).  We all saw it for a few minutes untill it desapeared ( some peole said it plunged into the st Laurent river so if it did, it changed it's directory to go down). Some other people said that an army aircraft tried to chase it but i haven't seen any aircraft at that time.  It must have been at least 5 times bigger than the sun.  It was just amazing an no one ever knew what it was. It left no trace of smoke on it's path.  The second time, i was back home after going to see a car accident that happened up the street from where i lived ( there must be a report somewhere at the police station about that accident if i ever want to know the exact date of ny sighting).  At that time , it was peach dark and there was no light post around.  I saw the exact same fireball on my way back home.  This time i was in the north direction and the firewall was heading West.  Same fireball, same speed, same everything but it was much furter.  I've seen shooting stars many many times before and after the events and i can tell that it was not one. The movement was constant. Both times, they were not going in an angle but on a straight horizontal line.  No noise, no crashing ( that i saw) , no reports in the medias.  What strikes me the most is when many years later i saw the movie about the Allagash Abductions.  The fireball looked a lot like the object in the movie. Was it the same object? I don't know.

{"text": "Strange Lights Indeed  Upon returning home on a beautiful spring evening, in the approximate year of 1973, rounding the corner to my country abode I saw 3 lights above the forest. It was evident that these lights were round in shape. The time was approximately 9:30pm - it was dark by now. The colour emanating from them was like bright headlights, white with a slight yellow hue, yet they were above the trees. I am a mother of 6 children and of sound mind and character. I don\u2019t make stuff up. I live near a very large, deep and pristine lake in NE Alberta, Canada.  My home is nestled in a forested area adjacent to one of the many bays of this lake, named Cold Lake. To the west of my home, approximately 4 miles, is the largest jet fighter Air Force Base in Canada. I am very used to and familiar with seeing and hearing these jet aircraft on a regular basis. What I witnessed this night was very different. After a few minutes of gazing upon this anomaly, one of the lights sped away in a westward direction. Its take-off or acceleration was like nothing I had ever seen in a conventional aircraft, jet, helicopter, prop-plane, whatever.  One could compare its take-off to the release of an arrow from a bow.  Also, there was absolutely no sound. I would estimate their distance away from me at \u00bd mile or less. This left 2 lights still in place above the trees. Given the estimate of \u00bd mile distance away, the actual size of the lights would likely be somewhat larger than virtual headlights. No structure, definition or appendage to the lights was visibly evident; it was a dark night. Upon my arrival home, one block from my initial visual, my son, very excited, asked if I had noticed the lights above the trees over there? I responded with, \"\u201cyes\", of course! We discussed the matter briefly, including the one that got away and decided to investigate further. The lights were hovering over a marshy area. The water was lit up due to the proximity of these lights emitting upon it. The light would pulsate seemingly on a timed or regular basis. It is important to note that there are no roads where these lights appeared; the only road is the one to my house. I state this so that no one will have notions that they were motor vehicles; how could they be?  At the time of this sighting we had 5 dogs. Don\u2019t ask why, we just did. As the light decreased from full intensity to zero light or pulsated from normal to no light, the dog\u2019s hair would stand straight up on their backs and they would bark, acting erratic in nature. When the light returned to normal the dog\u2019s behaviour did too. I said that my son and I were going to investigate further and so we did.  At approximately 10:00pm we decided to drive around to the top of a nearby knoll hoping to get a better view.  The lights were still visible but somehow appeared to have moved to a more distant location.  We watched them (the 2 remaining lights) for about 10 minutes and then decided to go home.  Upon attempting to start the car it was discovered that it was unable to turn over; it was \"dead,\" so-to-speak - very uncharacteristic of this vehicle because the battery was new and maintained regularly.  We supposed that somehow these lights had an effect on the operation of our car.  So, we had to walk home. As the evening progressed we would periodically look outside to see if the lights were still present.  It was midnight when we finally went to bed and the lights continued in place. I must say that the whole experience gave me what I would define as a spooky or unnerving sense of emotion. We returned to our car the next morning; it started without incident. Strangely enough, I spoke to a neighbour about this event.  Earlier in the evening, at about 7pm, he was travelling to his home and witnessed a light or lights travel immediately over his car at a high rate of speed.  Perhaps these lights were related or of the same group. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

{"text": "triangles made of 9 lights--no object seen I submitted an account of this event two or three years ago. It apparently was not received, as it is not in the website database. Since that submission, my recollection of the event has improved and therefore changed somewhat.  This is a recollection of a sighting of unknown lights in an unusual pattern sometime in the early 1970's, perhaps 1973 or 1974. I have tried to remember details and circumstances as accurately as possible. I am no aviation expert but I have grown up around aircraft, living near Reid-Hillview Airport, well before it was purchased by Santa Clara County and became a FSS, and I was acquanted with the former owner, his daughter and her family, as well as others who worked there or had tiedowns or hangars, so I know more than a little bit about aviation. There are some explanations for those who are unfamiliar with aviation as well as to explain why I do not believe that the lights belonged to any ordinary aircraft.  In the early 1970's I was at home during a late spring or summer evening and looked up to see nine orange/amber lights arrayed in three equilateral triangles which were themselves arrayed as one large equilateral triangle. Each orange light was at the point, or vertex, of each small triangle which themselves were at the points of the larger triangle, nine lights in all.  The night was warm and the smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen. There was no moon. Typically, above the smog, I am told there is a strong Westerly wind in the evening and into the night.  The array maintained perfect equilateral triangles as it headed roughly north-northwest in a straight line, It appeared to move slowly, like a light airplane but seemed to be silent. I watched the lights closely for some time, from when it was almost overhead, as it passed overhead and then was lost in the smog and reflected city lights somewhere over the north part of the city, trying to see the outline of some object and watching the lights to see if any moved independently, as well as for any lateral drift. I never could see any object, just the lights, none of the lights moved relative to the others and no lateral drift was observed. I estimated it could be seen for at least fifteen minutes.  The array was unusual as no navigation lights were seen: No red, no green, no white, no strobe or flashing lights of any kind, just steady orange/amber lights, which I realised later had the same color as low-pressure sodium street lights.  I know what aircraft look like in the sky at night, as I lived next to a small civil airport at that time and lived directly under the southbound departure route for the city's major airport and I often watched aircraft go over, trying to guess what kind it was. Sometimes, because of the smog, all that can be seen are the navigation lights. I have never seen such lights on any aircraft before or since. It occurred to me that the aircraft might have been some of the new SR-12's recently made public but the lights never moved relative to each other, they never drifted from course and there were no navigation lights, as would be required near the airports under VFR rules.  There was no engine noise. At the time, jet engines were still quite loud and some DC9's, 727's and 737's, as well as DC8's from Mexico were still using turbojets instead of the quieter fans. Neither turbine nor piston engines were heard.  The array was viewed through smog which reflected the streetlights so there was only a view of the orange/amber lights. No solid object was seen, no reflections. The smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen, neither could any aircraft from either airport. But somehow those lights could be seen.  Because of the smog,  the exceptionally slow speed and the lack of any visible shape I could not determine the altitude or the size of the object or objects attached to the lights.  I asked around to see if anyone else had seen the aray of lights; no one had. The FAA and the local newspaper both pointedly expressed their lack of interest in the event. It remained forgotten until I saw another very unusual sky object while in Monterey. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a crystal clear morning with no clouds and the sun was low in the east as it hit this object it looked like polished aluminum or stainless steel, it was not real large my best guess as to its size would be about 45-55 feet round but slightly cone shaped it had lights around bottom edge and they were rotating what looked to be in the opposite direction of the crafts rotation.   It came to within 120 yards of our home and then just stopped and hovered over the roof of our next door neighbors home and stayed in that spot for about 7 minutes and that\u2019s when  I called my mom and sister to also watch this object and we all observed it until it decided to leave.  It went straight vertical and went out of sight with no sound of any kind. I look back on this event and to this day can\u2019t understand why not one of us had taken any photos of this thing, we all had cameras but neither my sister, mother nor I thought to grab one and get pictures.  As close as this craft was it should have photographed extremely well.  I often think back and wonder if this thing had us hypnotized in some fashion.

{"text": "Very large black triangular craft observed on Okinawa Japan traveling from very slow to out of sight in seconds. I was in the United States Marine Corps, stationed at Camp Hansen on Okinawa, Japan.  The day was sunny with white cumulus clouds in the sky.   As I was walking along the base alone I noticed a shadow pass over me.  I looked up expecting to see a cloud.  Instead there was this large black triangular craft silently moving overhead very slowly.  It wasn't very high above the trees and I looked for identifiable markings but saw none.   I was familiar with most military aircraft but couldn't identify it so I thought maybe it was the SR 71 Blackbird which was still relatively secret.  My thought then was it couldn't be the Blackbird because it was as big as a B-52 and completely silent.   As I watched, it ascended straight up without pointing the nose of the aircraft up and disappeared in the clouds in an instant without any noise.  I've seen many aircraft flying at top speed including the F-4 Phantom during combat in Vietnam and this craft was much, much faster than any other.   I didn't report it because I had about 2 weeks left on my tour before going home and I thought I had just witnessed something I wasn't supposed to see.

{"text": "Not dreaming becasue I went back to the same police officer Dear Peter,  This is the first time telling anyone about this event since the occurrence, except really really close friends.  What troubles me the most is the first time I saw the alien was at a very young age on my way home from school.  But the siting was while myself and two friends were on our way from elmira up the road through elm hghts to purchase beer.  I was 18 at the time and I am currently 48 years old.  Anyway, as heading down the road(Iwasin the back seat leaning between the buckets) and this light in the sky was coming right towards us as if it were following the road. We immediately pulled over and got out of the car, there it was hovering above (bout 15 feet above) the telephone pole.  It zigged zagged acrossed the sky east to west 3 or 4 times like it was showing off or something.  Then headed up the road the same direction we were going to travel.  As you probably can imagine we were yelling and screaming like three girls. ((deleted))  and the like.  As it traveled up the road it was like it wanted us to follow it cause the speed of this was never seen on this earth.  After about 1/4 mile we were at the Chemung County Fair grounds where we pulled over again and it hovered over us and just kinda like it was taunting us.  My two friends stayed next to the car (as I recall)  I went into the road and was screaming to cars passing \"stop stop look up look up\"  people just looked at me like nothing was happening.  This haunts me to this day cause I know they'll be back again soon it has been a while since the last time.  We went directly to the police dept in Horseheads to report this and the officer said \"go home and sleep it off boys\".  I wanted so bad to get some kind of evidence I called the local airport which is 10 minutes away and asked for the tower.  They said because of the low altitude they could not verify anything on radar.   It continued to fly over the tree tops then we lost site of it.  The second part that is most troubling to me is a few years later I ask the one guy I was with \" hey remember when?\"  He had no recollection of the event even happening, this really really disturbs me.  I know I wasnt dreaming and I know we got that ((deleted)) beer after that had happened. I was ready to get lit then.   I havent spoke to the third party in this event cause I was afraid too after what already occurred.  BTW_ NONE of the ((deleted)) pics match the craft \"WE\" saw.And the ((deleted)) aliens arent little gray men cause the ones that have visited me are 5 1/5 to 6 feet tall and are flatt black with no whites in thier eyes.  The one time they visited me I was able to take my right hand and pinch my left arm sooo hard there was a black and blue mark when I awoke.  I couldnt open my eyes or move anything else......no otherdrugs involved here.sooo those that don't believe will be the most surprised..

{"text": "Unknown object with flashing lights and laser beam behind the Hou ARTCC building/very fast moving I was an air traffic controller at the time.  Often we'd see objects on our radar and on a few occasions NORAD would scramble on them. (That's another topic).   The incident that I'm reporting occurred after the end of my shift. Three of us were hanging around in the parking lot talking.  One controller made a comment that Venus was bright that night.   We then started visibly scanning the sky.  We noticed a brighter light to the North of the ARTCC building and wondered if the other light in the sky was indeed  Venus, then what could that be. (The back door of the center faces east and leads to the back parking lot). The object was standing still and was just visible above the far tree line. Someone made a comment that it was probably a street light.   An airliner became visible climbing out of IAH but farther North of the light we were looking at.  The light then dimmed.  As the plane got farther away on its climb out, the light came back to the full density as we had seen before.  That got our attention.  We were wondering out loud what it could be.   At that moment,  the object moved from our left to our right at an extremely fast speed and stopped immediatley. almost a blur.  As fast as you can turn your head from 10 oclock to 2 oclock was the speed it seemed to move. (if east was 12 on the clock, then the object moved from 10 to 2).  We could not judge how far away from us it was.   The object then just stood still for a minute or two.  Very bright red, blue and green lights starting flashing around the object.  A thin laser like beam of light, approximatley 6 to 12 inches in diameter, lit up part of the parking lot and starting scanning the parking lot.   All three of us ducked behind a car without saying a word.  The beam shut off and the flashing lights stopped.  The   white light on the object then came back on and the object began moving very slowly back to our ten oclock position and stopped at the exact location it was when we first noticied it.  We didn't say a word for about a minute.   When it sunk in what we had just seen, all three of us jumped in our cars and left for home.   The next day, we considered reporting this to a national hotline number in Washington D.C., that the FAA had provided us to report strange occurences that we observe on our radar screens (UFO's)  but no one ever  did for fear of losing our airman's certificate.

{"text": "In September 1976, I had another UFO encounter.  This time I was out of the Army and living with my former girlfriend H. L. in an apartment.   One night, she came running back inside the apartment screaming.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said that a UFO was hovering 200 feet above her head.  I didn\u2019t see anything.  I noticed she was hysterically crying.   I drove her to the Sacramento Sheriff\u2019s Department and they had her use their phone to call an 800 number to call Dr. Allen Hynek of the Chicago, Illinois Bureau of UFO Investigations.  Dr. Hynek sent us some forms to fill out, so she could describe what she saw.  Dr. Hynek later called me and asked what I was doing.  I told him I was watching \"Dick Van Dyke\u2019s The Comic\" on TV.  He asked what happened when Helen was screaming outside, I said the TV went on the blink, it displayed static and I was trying to fix the TV, when I heard her screaming.  He told me that when UFOs hover nearby, that they cause disturbances on car engines, TVs and radios.  This was a normal occurrence.  Later I learned that 2 other people in Sacramento saw the same UFO in two different locations and it was reported in the Sacramento Bee. From 1979 to 1986 I was back in the U.S. Army.  This time I joined Military Intelligence and I was stationed at PIC-K (Photo Interpretation Center, Korea).  This time my code name was \"Hollywood or Joe Hollywood,\"  I wore a black suit now and I was clean-cut.  I kept the sunglasses though.    My job as a 97 Bravo (Intelligence Analyst) was to work with Image Interpreters in identifying targets in North Korea and Red China, such as T-72 tanks, etc.  I would create what is called a \"sitmap\" pinpointing targets discovered by Image Interpreters, that studied reconnaissance aerial photographs.  I would categorize certain photos.  We would go on what is called a \u2018hot run\u2019 from Seoul, Korea, (Yongsan Barracks) to Osan Air Force Base.  The vehicle would display a placard that indicated that the vehicle could not be stopped for any reason.  There was a combination lock on the trunk of the vehicle and a combination lock in the suitcase inside the trunk,  the driver and myself would have \u00bd of the combination to open the trunk and the suitcase.  We would place the hotrolls (film) into the suitcase and head back to Seoul.   During my time as an Intelligence Analyst I categorized 6 photos taken by reconnaissance satellites of what appeared to be UFOs.  The UFOs moved on their own accord, as if they were guided by some kind of intelligence.  Therefore the 6 photos were significant by Military Intelligence.   The photos moved up the intelligence chain from Military Intelligence to DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).  From there, I don\u2019t know where the photos went.  While at PIC-K, I worked with Air Force Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, DIA, CIA, Marine Recon, US Army (Green Beret) Special Forces, 101st Airborne, US Army Rangers, 82nd Airborne, Delta Force, Navy Seals.  It was necessary for us to work closely with certain elite military groups.    Another strange photo I once saw was given to me to categorize.  It was a photo of an American POW in Vietnam, taken in 1981.  The photo went into a metallic box with a combination lock and disappeared up the intelligence channel.  The spooks (intelligence personnel) I worked with, would never discuss UFOs.  Most spooks belonged to some sort of secret society, most were Freemasons and I was a Rosicrucian.   When I departed Korea, I signed up for the 82nd  \"Screaming Eagles\" Airborne and Special Forces training and they were ready to send me to Ft. Gordon, Georgia and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and I was called to do a special assignment.  I received an H identifier and became an Army instructor and taught the Soviet Threat for OPFOR (Opposing Forces).  I wore a Russian uniform, ski mask, black gloves and talked with a fake Russian accent and called myself \"Corporal Dowbowski.\"  I would instruct the Soviet Threat, teaching the W.E.F.T. (Wings, Engine, Fuselage and Tail) on Soviet Aircraft, kill zones on Soviet aircraft and land roaming vehicles, the use of many Soviet weapons from the AK-47 to the SVD Sniper Rifle in which I was proficient.   During my time with OPFOR, I learned from Intelligence circles, that the Russian KGB also knew and were aware of what exactly UFOs were and where they came from. To this day, I don\u2019t know the answers to the UFO mystery, but hopefully one day our Government will disclose what they know to the public.", "stats": "Occurred : 9/15/1976 20:00  (Entered as : 09/15/1976 20:00) Reported: 4/28/2006 8:42:37 AM 08:42 Posted: 5/15/2006 Location: Sacramento, CA Shape: Oval Duration:6 minutes", "date_time": "9/15/76 20:00", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50322.html", "city": "Sacramento", "state": "CA", "shape": "Oval", "duration": "6 minutes", "summary": "In September 1976, I had another UFO encounter.

{"text": "The hi-pitches noise is what first alerted me to the disk. My family was watching t.v when the t.v started static and picture problems. The lights started blinking from dim to bright.My dogs were whining and scratching the back door wildly.Keep in mind my German sheperd had been qaurentine twice for biting people riding or walking ddown the alley.As well as a mean standard poodle. I went to let them in the house and when I opened the door they ran me over peeing and pooping as they crossed over me.The noise was very hi-pitched.I was 13 yrs old.My first reaction was to run where they did under my bed. I went as far as the bed room and ran back to lookfor my mom and brother. The front door was opened and I went to the porch and our neighbors and my mom and brother were all looking in the sky. I looked up and saw a huge disk shape houvering above the neighbor hood. It was so huge it could have destroyed at least two blocks if it landed. Now it gets even stranger.It is dark outside the sky is just a shade of dk blue but not quite black. The ship is almost the same color or a shade just lighter from the color of the sky. I'm histerical and run in the room where my dogs are. I grab the phone to call police,my dad anyone because I'm scared but remember I have to go getmy mom and little brother. The sound of the ship is head jolting. I ran to get my mom and brother in the house but they just stair in the sky. I grab my neighbor hand and tell her to run. But could'nt budge her. I ran back to the porch behind the bushes surrounding the porch and look up in ahh. I notice that it is round in shape like a washer that goes on a screw then criss-crossing are bars that connect to the center of the disk which is like a black smoke-glass sphere. It didn't have windows and I would have to guess maybe that the center was like a smoke glass marble and they were watching us. Anyway, the outer part begin to have lights red,green,yellow,blue four in a row from my angle i could see blinking at the front side and back of the ship. They blinked in a harmony like way. Then as it went higher u in the sky it's shape seemed to change and the criss-cross bars went in and the disk was smaaler in size and it went up and shot ahead in the sky so fast it was gone. I ran out into the yard where everyone seem to be calm and alert. I was screaming did you see it lets call someone. And mom said calm down it's time for bed. Pat the neighbor was telling every one good night. I was alarmed that everyone was so calm and non-shalaunt about the situation.The next day my mom the neighbors all of them said they didn't remember seeing anything last night. But they couldn't explain why my legs were all scratched up from the dogs running me over in the kitchen and the back door being almost scratched in too from the dogs. I've told this story to every one I know and they just look at me like I crazy. And as god is my witness, I've been when three of them and together they witnessed again another ufo sighting. Do they keep an eye on you once you spot one of them. I've never seen a allien, but I  have seen at least three other ships since I have seen that one at 13. One had three lights and was triangle shape, one just a blue sphere never loosing altitude and traveled in a perfectly straight direction. and yet another like jacks shaped. You know the jacks and ball little girls played as a child. With light on all five ends. They were at close distances and was also a bit over whelming even as I am now a adult. I had the same fear rush threw me as I did as the 13 year old girl who seen the mother of all ships. Nothing has ever come close to the sighting I seen at the house in Dallas,Tx. Whats even stranger is..... Since 1998 I have had a series of dreams.That seem to be messages from alliens. They were very clear and in color that was so bright.

{"text": "Close encounter with metallic craft near Gaithersburg, MD in 1977 The following was described to me a 45 year old man whom I believe to be very sincere and credible.  I do not have contact information for the witness presently, but I can get it. In 1977 the witness (age 17 at the time)and his cousin were returning home to obey their 12 a.m. curfew.  As they were heading up a road towards the Heights in Montgomery Village, MD, near Gaithersburg, the witness saw a light through some trees at the top of the hill and asked his cousin \"What's that?\". His cousin replied \"They're digging a lake up there; it must be some construction lights.\"  They continued up the hill, came around a bend in the road, and saw a cigar-shaped object hovering over a telephone pole approximately 40 feet in the air and 50 feet in front of them.  The witness and his cousin stopped the car and got out to look at the object, which he described as shaped like a \"one-manned submarine\", being about the size of a school bus, and as having a metallic skin, 2 beams projecting from the \"front,\" and a row of \"portholes\" and non-blinking red and green lights around the circumference.  The object was completely silent and stationary for approximately 20 seconds, then made a soft, mechanical \"verrrt\" sound and began to move slowly away.  The witness emphasized 2 things: how \"man-made\" and \"nuts and bolts\" the object seemed (\"like an airliner with no tail, wings, or jet engines\") and the strange way that it appeared to move away slowly, yet diminished rapidly in size until it disappeared.  He had a difficult time describing exactly how the object departed.  He said that the surface of the craft was visible from the glare of the projecting beams (\"kind'a like laser beams, not spreading out like headlights\"), and that it was metallic.  There were also dark patches above the view ports where he thought there was some movement visible (as in something moving inside the object).  The witnesses' car exhibited no electromagnetic effects from the close proximity of the craft; the engine continued to idle and the headlights remained on, and neither witness suffered any physiological effects.  He said that he and his cousin were open-mouthed in amazement, but never felt frightened during the encounter.  What also astonished the witness was that this sighting took place shortly before midnight in the middle of a suburban bedroom community with many houses in the area, but no one came out of their home to investigate the bright lights above their neighborhood.  He looked in the newspapers, but failed to find any reports of UFO sightings in the next several days. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I even submitted photos last year that showed objects in front of me and around me while driving from Texas to California.  Needless to say I have had a few sightings.  What brought me to write today was that I noticed a few reports from the 1977-78 period of pretty much what I saw myself in the city of Whittier.  I am in my late 30's now and at the time I was in 6th grade.. The time was close to 4pm because my friend's mom was the manager of a donut shop and we would go pig out there everyday after school.  We got to the corner of Lambert & Colima when one of the kids yelled \"hey look a rocket\"!. We looked up towards the Hacienda Hts area.  There is a big hill you have to go over that leads into Hacienda Heights using Colima Rd.  We saw the object in plain sight but at first all we could see was a flame coming out of something.  It was right above Colima Rd at the top of the hill.  That is a major pathway for planes coming into LAX.  They come in every few minutes so someone had to have seen something.  We continued watching the object and then it started to move high into the sky but towards our direction and settling directly above.  As it got above our heads (several thousand feet in the air), I could see it perfectly, it was a huge  Triangle with different colored blinking lights on the side (specifically blue & red), a flame coming out of the back, and a bright white light at the tip.  It stayed up there for at least 2 hours.  Didn't move.  The time was now way after 5pm and it started to get dark. The triangle was now blending in perfectly with the stars.  I remember still faintly being able to see the red/orange flame coming out the back and not really being able to see the red & blue lights on the sides anymore.  My neck was hurting so badly from looking straight up for all that time that I finally had to take a few minuets rest.  When I looked back up I couldn't find it but all the kids were saying \"it's right there\" and pointing it out to me.. Well I just couldn't find it anymore because it just blended in with the stars so well. I ran home to tell my family but who would believe a young kid saying such a story.  I mean, if it were that big, flying in LAX air traffic space, in plain sight, then why was there no news covereage or any mention of it??  Well I never did hear anything about it but I know what I saw. It is fresh in my memory to this day as if it just happened yesterday.  Who knows maybe since we were kids, the er uh \"visitors\" only allowed us to see them.  But whatever it was, it was huge, it was close, and it was real.   I would also like to add that a few years later (early 80's) I was watching a UFO documentary and they told the story of a man in either Wyoming or Montana that shot at a UFO that was chasing him.  Well guess what?  He drew the exact same thing I saw that day.  The triangle, flame coming out the back, bright white light at the tip, and different colored lights on the side.   I got excited and called my brother to come watch and asked him if he remembered the UFO story I told him about a few years back, I said \"that's exactly what I saw\".  He just basically said \"are you sure\" and I said \"I'm positive\" (to which he replied \"what a trip\").   I guess I got so excited because someone other than the group of kids and myself actually had an encounter with this thing and drew it in all exactness of what I saw that day.. I read about the enormous Chevron craft seen by a woman over the 605 fwy that same time period as well as another story relating to the same info and I knew I had to include my experience as well.  The area over Colima Rd is a sort of UFO hotspot.  In 1998 after leaving a friend's house just before midnight, I drove up Colima Rd coming from Hacienda to Whiiter, and as I neared the top of the hill a White light just shot across in front of me. I sped up to try and get another look but it was long gone.  It was just like a Blip but I saw it and it was not a reflection from any other lights because for those who know that hilltop, there is a small area where there are no street lights, that's where it flew across.   I feel relieved in a sense to hear that other people have come across what I saw that day back in the late 70's.  Although I know what I saw, it's just so relieving to know that I wasn't alone and that others came across some big, weird stuff they can't explain either.  I gotta tell you, seeing something like that is better than getting your first bicycle on Christmas - it really is. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I come from a family of five and my father is a well known surgeon in the area.  I am currently finishing a BS degree at a well known university studying Geog and Gis etc.   Unfortunatly I recently fell victom to Leukemia and had to take some time off school.  I ve been watching alot of History channel etc on ufos and when I can I sometimes listen to coast to coast, (unless I just can't bear to listen to some of the bs from some people).  Well one night, I was lying outside on my deck on a recliner looking up at the clear dark sky.  When all of a sudden a cigar shaped craft with green glowing like airplain windows flew over my house moving at the speed of a falling star except it stoped and I think looked at me and then resumed from 0  to the speed of a falling star and went twards the SFO airport and curved as it left.  Never the less this was no falling star.   I've done some reasearch on the ufo subject and what bothers me most about it are all the people who have everything to loose and nothing to gain by coming forward with knoweldge of this subject.   I hope this is helpfull to someone.  Also I do beleive if you concentrate on seeing a ufo enough it could appear (maby they are able to focus on thought) however I dont suggest it.

{"text": "Pensacola, FL- a space craft of immese size appeared without sound In the spring-summer of 1978, my best friend and I were driving on Interstate 10 in Pensacola. We were heading East to Santa Rosa County. The sun had gone down as we traveled on Interstate 10. As I was driving, I was close to the water tower that is on the interstate which is just before the bridge going over Escambia Bay.  All of a sudden and out of nowhere, a space ship was suspended over the interstate before the bridge. There was no sound eminating from the spacecraft however, it was extremely large; almost covering the width of the interstate.  Also, it was vast in height in comparison to a five or six-story building.  Underneath the craft, the structure seemed to be comprised of steel girders with a circular area in the middle of the bottom of the spacecraft. It was lit up so that one could see the structural design of the craft. The main superstructure was very large with colored panels lighting up at times. I recall a red, blue or green, and yellow panel lit up as if the space craft was tying to communicate something using color and the sequence of when the panels lit up. There was no sound coming from this sighting. It was just suspended in space. It was so close to my friend and me. Then all of a sudden the lights went out and in total darkness and without sound, the craft moved over the water tower. It was hovering over the tower when out of the circular area located at the bottom of the craft, a light shown down on the water tower. It was as if the light was searching the tower and nearby land where the tower was built. Again, the lights went out and without and trace of sound, the spacecraft moved a little west and farther into the sky. Again, it was suspended in the sky and the only lights eminating from it were white lights. If I am not mistaken, the lights seemed to be outlining the perimeter of the spacecraft. It has been several years since my friend and I saw this sighting. If I am not mistaken, once the craft had allowed us to see the white lights surrounding the perimeter, it fled in an amazing speed towards the southeast. That was an incredible evening for both my friend and me. Once arriving to my home, excitedly, he and I ran into the house sharing this information with my parents. I called the local newspaper and radio station(s) explaining what we had seen and asked if anyone had seen the same thing to please get in touch with me. However, as was in a lot of cases back in the 70's, the receiver(s) of my inquiries laughed in unbelief. Today, I know this sighting was real. I don't have to prove anything to anyone to the reality of this matter because I, as well as my friend, know what we saw was truth. I only wish I could have communicated with the intellectuality of the spacecraft to understand more. But yet, maybe another time will take place so that intelligence can share and learn from other sources within the universe.

At about 4th street, we all stopped to look at some extremely bright lights out in the ocean near Atlantic City.  In a matter of seconds, the lights were directly above the condominium complex at 4th Street and the boardwalk in Ocean City.  They were three lights in a triangle shape.  There was absolutely no sound.  We all just stood there in shock, looking up at the lights, trying to discern a craft or something.

{"text": "3 ft. dia  tan colored spherical object manuveing at 120+ knts. I was piloting a Piper Cherokee 140 airplane returning to the Gadsden Airport after some recreational flying approaching from the north about 5 miles out, when I passed the object at about 1000 Ft. above ground level.  It was about 20 ft. off of my left wing.  It was about 3 feet in diameter, tan in color, and looked like a weather balloon except that it had no inflation nozzle, no radiosonde attached to it, and it was perfectly round.  Weather balloons have a teardrop shape to them when strapped to a weather gathering payload.  I circled back to get a closer look and noticed what appeared to be a red crecent moon or a hammer and scycle shape on it reminiscent of the emblem on the former Soviet flag.  As I circled around a second time to get closer look, the object moved away from me and maintained a distance of about 50 to 75 yard spacing between itself and my plane. When I became aware that the object could manuver, I was certainly rattled.   I tried to pursue the object about a minute or two but it accellerated away to the point that I could not keep up with it.  I was traveling at 120 knotts.   Scared, I opted to return to the Gadsden Airport.  When I arrived home, I reported the sighting to the Anniston Flight Service Station.  I believe the attendant at the FSS was unofficially impressed, but I don't know weather or not he officially filed my report.  I believe the UFO to be either alien, a Top Secret USA probe, or the Russians aren't telling us something.  I maintain that what I saw was not a weather balloon and flew under its own power.

{"text": "Three lights in the shape of a triangle. I was looking at this web sight for the first time and saw an event entered 5/1/2005 that must be the same event that I experienced.  The writer dated the event 5/12/1980 but said he wasn't sure.  I think the event was approximately September of 1978 or 1979.  I was 16 or 17 and driving home from work on interstate 70.  I was headed east from Indianapolis to Greenfield.   I would say somewhere between the Mt. Comfort Rd. exit and the Greenfield exit, I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were primarily white but I do remember some occasional red and blue.  It would have been around 9:15 based on where I was on my trip home.  The lights moved in relation to each other and formed different sizes of the same triangle. I exited interstate 70 at Greenfield and turned north on highway 9.  I then went approximately 1 mile until I reached 300 north and turned west. (I was still headed home)  Very shortly after I turned onto 300 north, I could see something above me.  I have always described it as a \"density\".  It was too close above me to make out a shape.  When I looked up, it was big enough that I couldn't see sky on any side of the object.  I have also always said it was probably bigger that two 2 story houses.  I have also said it would be like standing under a large passenger jet, that is on the ground, and looking up.  You could just see the underneath.  I couldn't see the lights at that time and I could not make out the color of the object, just that there was something above me. There was no sound. I am guessing this lasted for just a few seconds until I drove past it.  I went home and made it by my normal time which was approximately 9:30.  I told my parents and they could tell I was visibly excited.  The next morning, I was sitting in my high school home room and they came over the intercom and said the National Enquirer was in the office and wanted to interview anyone having seen a UFO.  I did not go because I was too embarrassed to get up in front of the home room.  I do not know if anybody went.  That evening, the Greenfield Daily Reporter ran a front page article.  In that article, it reported finding markings in a field.  These markings were found somewhere on the opposite side of highway 9 than I had turned.  I turned to the west of 9 and these were found on the east of 9 and at about the same area as 300 north.  I feel it must have been headed east when I saw it.  I match my dates due to where I was working.  I really felt it was in the fall because of feeling new in the home room class.  I did go back to the Hancock County Library a couple of years ago and tried to find the paper.  I was unable to find any article, but I did concentrate on the fall only.  I will make an attempt to go back soon and start checking all of 1978 and 1979.  I will also check to make sure that all of the papers are there.

{"text": "Missing Time: Two People My mother and I have a long history of UFO sightings/involvement.  It's highly possible that there was an abduction experience when I was not quite three, and my mother was 23, involving not only us but a busload of soldiers en route to Augusta, GA, in 1957.  But when the incident I'm reporting now happened, I was around 25, and my mother was 45.  I had driven from my suburban Alexandria home to visit my mother in Front Royal, VA, and we decided it was a lovely summer afternoon for a drive.  We went on one of our old favorite rides: to a nearby mountain where an airliner had crashed a number of years before, just up the road from a semisecret military installation.  The road led through some beautiful countryside, and we'd always enjoyed taking leisurely drives and talking about life in general.  My mother and I had seen many UFOs, both together and separately, and had, as mentioned earlier, a bizarre bus trip when I was very young, but on this summer day the conversation was light, and the subject matter was strictly terrestrial... except, of course, for our traditional speculation on what went on at that semisecret military complex out in the boondocks yet so close to DC.  We were travelling north in bright sunlight early in the afternoon... then the next thing we remember, we were travelling south, about 20 miles from where we last remembered being, and the sun was almost setting.  We both seemed to be coming out of a brain fog -- speech was very difficult.  My mother spoke first, saying in effect \"How did we get here, and how can it be this late?\" It took great effort for me to respond that I had no idea.  We literally did not say another word for the remaining forty minutes of the trip -- very unusual for two chatty sorts, especially given the circumstances.  I could not comprehend how I could have been driving in such an apparent fugue state, and that both of us were in the same condition was quite disturbing.  Neither of us could remember a single thing that had happened to us during the five or so hours just past... and neither of us were capable of talking about it -- or talking about anything else, at that time.  Even years later, it was exceedingly difficult for us to discuss the incident beyond the bare known facts, and both of us vividly recalled the incredible introversion of our thoughts on the way back to her house.  But we both, as we managed to admit to each other years later, were positive that we had seen \"something,\" that a craft (UFO) was involved.  Our difficulty talking about this event even years later seemed perhaps the result of a mental block of some sort placed by an outside source.  Especially given our individual and shared histories with UFO sightings (also witnessed by others numerous times), there was little doubt in either of us that we'd had an intense and lengthy encounter with something, and some entities, decidedly not of this world.  The roads we were travelling  My mother was an accountant for a furniture/appliance store, and I was a chef/restaurant owner (physically a bit disabled now, thanks to years of heavy lifting, etc.) and am now a professional artist and writer.  This report is probably only the first in a somewhat long line -- it's time I deal openly with the strangeness in my life that seems to have revolved around UFOs, and this is step one.  I'm very open to discussing the full range of experiences and incidents with an investigator, if you or an associate are interested.  I will also consider hypnosis in order to penetrate the mental veil concealing the two incidents of missing time, providing that the hypnotherapist is reputable and well-versed in probable abduction incidents.  Those two incidents have haunted me for so long -- once for nearly fifty years -- and I'd like to know the truth, however discomfiting it may be.
