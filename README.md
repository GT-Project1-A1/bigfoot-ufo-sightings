Extract UFO Data:
The following data set was used to gather information on UFO sightings:

https://data.world/timothyrenner/ufo-sightings/workspace/file?filename=nuforc_reports.json

Data files existed in both csv and json format.  The json version was not as clean, so we chose to use that version for the project.

The json file was downloaded locally.  A Jupyter Notebook (extract_ufo_json.ipynb) was created.
